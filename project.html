            <h2>Why are remote repositories necessary?</h2>
            <p>Repositories is a place, room or container where something is deposited or stored.</p>
            <p>Here is a a simplified breakdown of why Github repositories are important:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Central Hub: They hold all project files, documentation and version history</li>
                <li>Collaboration: Multiple people can work on the project at the same time</li>
                <li>Track changes: You can see who made what changes and when.</li>
                <li>Pull Request: Propose updates and get them reviewed before merging.</li>
                <li>Branches: Work on different features and versions without messing up the main code.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What are the steps involved in creating a project on GitHub?</h2>
            <p>Details of all the steps:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sign in/up to create an account</li>
                <li>Create a new repository: clicking the + in the upper right corner</li>
                <li>Name your repo, add a description and decide if it shoyld be public or private</li>
                <li>Intialize the repo with a README file you like.</li>
                <li>Create a .git folder on your local machine</li>
                <li>Connect your local repository (git) to the remote repo (github)</li>
                <li>Add files and folders to the Staging Area</li>
                <li>Commit those files and folders with a message to save them locally</li>
                <li>Rename your master branch to main branch</li>
                <li>Push the code from your local repository to the remote repo</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Details the relevant git commands relevant to creating a project locally</h2>
            <p>Here's a cheat sheet for setting up a project locally using Git:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Intialize a repository:</li>
                <li>Setting a new git repository = git init</li>
                <li>Add files = git add (filename or git add . (dot adds all the files))</li>
                <li>Commit changes = git commit -m 'Initial commit' (commits added files with a message)</li>
                <li>Create a Remote repository on GitHu (via GitHub website)</li>
                <li>Create a new repository and get the repository URL</li>
                <li>Link local repo to github = git remote add origin (repository-url)</li>
                <li>Connects your local repo to the GitHub repo</li>
                <li>Push changes to GitHub = git push -u origin master</li>
                <li>Pushes your commited changes to the master branch on GitHub. Replace master w. main if necessary</li>
                <li>Check repo status: git status</li>
                <li>Shows the current state of your working directory and staging area</li>
                <li>See commit history: git log</li>
                <li>Displays the commit history for the repository</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Details the git commands to link the local and remote repos</h2>
            <p>Add remote repository:</p>
            <p>Note: When you make a new repository on the same at the bottom you can copy paste one by one and enter on bash</p>
            <ul>
                <li>git remote add origin https://github.com/bushra-rauf/ada.git</li>
                <li>git branch -m main</li>
                <li>git push -u origin main</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Detail how other people can contribute to the project</h2>
            <p>The contribution begin with the HTML code writing and styling the website</p>
            <p>TO contribute to a project in GitHub, other people can follow these steps</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The Repository: They can create their own copy of the project by forking the repository. This allows them to make changes without affecting the original project.</li>
                <li>Clone the Repository: After forking, they can clone their forked repository to their local machine using Git. This allows them to work on the project offline.</li>
                <li>Create a Branch: It's a good practice to create a new branch for their changes. This keeps the main branch clean and allows for easier collaboration.</li>
                <li>Make Changes: They can then make their desired changes or additions to the project in their branch.</li>
                <li>Commit Changes: Once they are satisfied with their changes, they should commit them with a clear and descriptive message explaining what they did.</li>
                <li>Push Changes: After committing, they can push their changes back to their forked repository on GitHub</li>
                <li>Open a Pull Request: Finally, they can open a pull request from their branch in the forked repository to the original repository. This is where they can discuss their changes with the project maintainers and get feedback.</li>
                <li>Engage in Discussion: They should be open to feedback and ready to make further changes if necessary. Collaboration is key!</li>
            </ol>
            <p>By following these steps, anyone can contribute to a project on GitHub and help improve it! If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!</p>
